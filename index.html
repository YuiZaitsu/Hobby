<p>What exactly is anime?
Anime (pronounced AH-nee-may ) is a term for a style of Japanese comic book and video cartoon animation in which the main characters have large doe-like eyes. Many Web sites are devoted to anime. Anime is the prevalent style in Japanese comic books or manga .One of the main reasons why anime has stood the test of time and grown in popularity across the world is due to its unique ability to grow with its viewers. ... Anime has become more popular overseas in recent years due to a shrinking Japanese population leading to an increased export-minded trade.  A cartoon is a form of two-dimensional illustrated visual art. ... The main difference is that an anime is considered a Japanese style of cartoons in the West. Many English-language dictionaries define anime as “a Japanese style of motion-picture animation” or as “a style of animation developed in Japan.”  I love Animes like Demon slayer,Naruto and Haikyu.
